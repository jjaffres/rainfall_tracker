# rainfall_tracker
The rainfall_tracker (MATLAB / GNU Octave) toolbox is utilised to extract rainfall data from either gridded netCDF files (rainfall_tracker.m) or pre-processed Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN)-Daily data (rainfall_tracker_ghcnd.m). A detailed user's guide is provided with the toolbox.
